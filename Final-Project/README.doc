This goal of this project was to create a Generative Art Gallery.

The gallery has 6 art pieces in total, that can also be combined to make more than 6. The purpose of this script is to be used as an
educational tool during this pandemic, for parents of children ages 5 and under! This is intended to be an interactive experience for small 
children as each art piece is generated by the user's keyboard clicks.

TUTORIAL: there are six shapes to choose from (circle, oval
star, rectangle, triangle, and polygon). One running, the purpose of this code is to ask your
child verbally, "What letter does the word (say shape here) start with?" With that
your child, for example, will press C on the keyboard for circle if they know it, 
and the art associated with that paricular shape will be generated in a 
random color. With that random color, an additional
learning application would be for your child to also name the color the art is generated in!
repeat this process for as many or all the shapes you'd like. 

Hit the spacebar to reset your window before selecting a new shape.
