Both scripts included in this folder incorporate sounds and animations. 
This is a two-part project to build an audiovisulizer--animation that changes in response to audio input (voice, music, etc.). 
The first part, (PC08) is focused on making the visual aspect. 

PC08 is a starter script for PC09, where shapes and sounds are added into a pygame window. 
In PC09 animations are added that are triggered by the sound. 

Both files will use the same Friends.ogg file. 
Simply download the py files as well as the ogg file in the same folder to run both scripts.
